## Custom Keyboard Shortcuts for Google Earth Web
The main reason I wanted to create this was to make entering and exiting street view mouse-click-free. I always use the North-top orientation so I also wanted to be able to reset the view without moving my hands. The extension maps the F key to the top-north view shortcut and the D and E keys to the street view toggle button by default. You can also press D or E while in street view mode to quit it and go back to map view mode. It also modifies many other shortcuts that are scattered all over the keyboard to bring them near the left hand home row so you can use them without lifting your hand. You can easily customize the keys from the extension pop up.

### Why?
You can keep your left hand at its natural home row position on the keyboard and save yourself many mouse clicks to make your Google Earth experience much smoother.
