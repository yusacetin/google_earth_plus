### (Very) Small but impactful enhancements to Google Earth Web
Do you hate how you have to click the street view button at the bottom right of the screen again every time you click the button all the way at the top left of the screen to quit street view? Do you hate how it doesn't reset to top-north view afterwards so you also have to click the compass button? Then you might like this Chrome extension.

### Installation
Make sure developer mode is enabled in Chrome, then go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the files.

### What does it do?
The extension maps the F key to the top-north view shortcut and the D key to the street view toggle button. You can also press D while in street view mode to quit it and go back to map view mode.

### Why?
You can keep your left hand at its natural home row position on the keyboard and save yourself 3 button clicks (that are positioned at the opposite corners of the screen) every time you enter and exit street view.

### More features?
Don't count on it. Feel free to fork. 

### License?

### Known issues
Sometimes F doesn't work. Reloading fixes. Not sure if the problem is with the extension or Google Earth as the compass button tends to break sometimes.
